I currently serve as a Research Associate with the Lab for Applied Science within the [Earth System Science Center of the University of Alabama in Huntsville](https://www.uah.edu/essc). With a background in geographic information systems, earth sciences, and data analysis and over 7 years of experience supporting conservation and ecosystem management. Through my work supporting the [SERVIR program](https://science.nasa.gov/category/missions/servir/), specialize topics include mangrove monitoring, greenhouse gas emission estimation, and forest degradation detection while focusing on building the capacity of collaborators and local users on the application of geospatial technologies to solve environmental challenges. As project scientist for the [SERVIR CArbon Pilot Project](https://s-cap.servirglobal.net/), I support the development of an emission estimation ensemble to assist our partners in REDD+ reporting and emission tracking. Methods from this work were incorporated into the [2024 Belize Zero-Forest Reference Level](https://redd.unfccc.int/media/belize-zero-forest-reference-level-report-2024.pdf) submission to the UNFCCC.
